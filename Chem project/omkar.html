            </h1>
            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The reason for this is that plastic is the biggest culprit when it comes to waste production; we throw away more plastic than any other material. Not only this, it also accounts for around 90% of all the waste that bobs around in our seas and oceans. The 3rd worrying factor is that it can take hundreds of years to biodegrade, making it a serious problem for future generations to deal with as well.

                But it's not all doom and gloom. There is a constant stream of new and innovative ideas to tackle the mounting problem of plastic waste. From plastic roads to plastic training shoes, people are finding new ways to deal with the issues at hand.
                
                For example, researchers from the National Council of Scientific and Technological Research (CONICET) in Argentina have come up with a novel way to turn used plastic drinking bottles into eco-friendly building bricks. The PET (polyethylene terephthalate) material the bottles (and bricks) are made from is as strong as a conventional house brick made from sand and cement.</p>

              <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">They also have several significant advantages over conventional bricks - they're thinner and lighter, have superb heat insulating properties (5 times more than standard bricks) and are just as strong as their stony counterparts. They're also great at insulating against noise and it only takes 20 bottles on average to make one brick.

                Each brick helps rid the world of discarded plastic and is cheaper and more fuel efficient to manufacture than conventional bricks. It's also less energy intensive than recycling the plastic into other forms.

              <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">They are more massive and therefore better at heat accumulation and have a longer warm/cool cycle. Cement bricks make a building fire-safe due to their noncombustible nature. Cement bricks can withstand high temperatures. Cement bricks are resistant to wind and wate</p>

            <p class="lg:pl-6 lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">There are also downsides. Because ecobricks are plastic, like the plastic they're comprised of, they don't decompose. If they melt, they release gases that are harmful to human health and the environment. Plastic is made from oil, a fossil fuel.</p>

            <h1 class="sm:text-3xl text-2xl font-medium title-font text-gray-900 lg:w-1/3 lg:mb-0 mb-4">Why you should prefer plastic bricks?</h1>
            <p class="lg:pl-6 lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">Ecobricks have many advantages over conventional construction materials. They're zero cost, absorb abrupt shock loads, are reusable, easy to work with, lightweight, and repurpose the plastic that's rapidly threatening to take over our ecosystems. If made with hollow cells, they can be filled with compacted dirt, increasing their potential utility for projects lasting several years. They can be used for insulation; in this application they may b left as such with hollow cells and these cells may be filled with husk. Competitively, the bricks are not only environmentally friendly, but due to the plastic elements, they have a high density and an industry-low water absorption rate of 1.1%, enabling a building to have a longer lifespan.</p>

            <h1 class="sm:text-3xl text-2xl font-medium title-font text-gray-900 lg:w-1/3 lg:mb-0 mb-4">Compression problems.</h1>
            <p class="lg:pl-6 lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">One of the drawbacks of these type of bricks is that they can't be used like standard bricks because the plastic compresses under heavy structural loads. However, their saving grace is that because of their awesome sound and thermal insulating properties, they make superb wall fillers. ByBlocks are perfect for non-load-bearing walls, retaining walls and walls that require soundproofing. Also, because of the flexible nature of plastic, they're ideally suited to earthquake zones too or you can simply just use them for making durable, long-lasting fences.</p>
